Documentation
=============

*"Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self."*

*-- Damian Conway*

Documentation is a critical part of any software project. It is the first
point of contact for new users, and it is the first thing developers look 
for when they need to understand how a piece of code works. It is
also a great way to share your knowledge with the community.

*As a minimum*, it's good to have a README file that describes:

* What the project is about.
* How to install the project.
* How to use the project.

Inside your code, comments can be very useful to describe what a function or 
script does. Even better, is to add `docstrings <https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/#what-is-a-docstring>`_
to your functions and classes. Docstrings are long-form
comments beneath class and functions declaration that typically describe:

* What the function or class does.
* Its inputs and their data types.
* Its outputs and their data types.

For example:

.. code:: Python

    def add(a, b):
        """
        Add two integers.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : int
            First integer.
        b : int
            Second integer.

        Returns
        -------
        result : int
            Sum of inputs.

        """

        assert isinstance(a, int)
        assert isinstance(b, int)
        return a + b

A documentation generator, such as `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__,
can then be used to render your docstrings into a static website, as shown at
:func:`pydevtips.utils.add` for the above example.


This website can be hosted *for free* on `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ (like this!)
or on GitHub pages. It is also possible to host the documentation on your own
server.

Below we describe how to setup your project to generate documentation with Sphinx,
and how to host it on ReadTheDocs.

Initial setup
-------------

So you've diligently written your docstrings (or used GitHub Copilot!), and you 
want to generate your documentation.

Here are some recommended steps to get started with Sphinx:

#. Create a lightweight virtual environment for building the documentation. This can save a lot of time when building and publishing documentation remotely, as we'll show with `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__.

    .. code:: bash
        
        # create new environment, press enter to accept
        conda create -n docs_env python=3.9

        # activate environment
        conda activate docs_env

        # install requirements stored in `docs` 
        # (may differ from our file depending on your needs)
        (docs_env) cd docs
        (docs_env) pip install -r requirements.txt

#. Inside your virtual environment, run ``sphinx-quickstart`` to creates a lot of the boilerplate configurations. This will guide you through a set of questions, such as your project details. We recommend creating separate ``source`` and ``build`` directories.
#. Build the documentation, e.g. with ``make html`` (from inside the ``docs`` folder).
#. Open ``docs/build/html/index.html`` in a browser to see your initial documentation!

Editing your documentation
--------------------------

The ``index.rst`` file will serve as the "homepage" for your documentation (built into ``index.html``).
Typically, people have the same content as their README. Before you copy-and-paste
the contents (!), you can directly insert the contents with the following line.

.. code:: rst

    .. include:: ../../README.rst

.. note::

    `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`__
    is the default plaintext markup language used by Sphinx. At this point, you may be thinking:
    *"But my README is a Markdown file (.md)..."*. While there are `tools <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html>`__
    to make Sphinx compatible with Markdown, I think you will save yourself more headaches to simply
    switch to reStructuredText. There are also `online tools <https://cloudconvert.com/md-to-rst>`__
    to help you with that.


Adding new pages to your documentation amount to:

#. Creating new RST files.
#. Including them in your ``index.rst`` file.
#. Rebuilding the documentation, e.g. with ``make html`` (from inside the ``docs`` folder).

You may also need to edit the ``conf.py`` file to use different features.
Check out our `index.rst <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/main/docs/source/index.rst>`__
and `conf.py <https://github.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/blob/main/docs/source/conf.py>`__
files for example configurations.


You can do a clean build of your documentation with the following commands:

.. code:: bash

    # inside `docs` folder
    make clean
    make html


Pro-tips
--------

* Changing to the ReadTheDocs theme inside `conf.py <https://github.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/blob/e51dd62a2dd156fdd3e559be3930f87f2a4e6405/docs/source/conf.py#L75>`__.
* `Intersphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/intersphinx.html>`__ for linking to other documentations.
  In the ``conf.py`` file: `add <https://github.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/blob/e51dd62a2dd156fdd3e559be3930f87f2a4e6405/docs/source/conf.py#L43>`__
  the Sphinx extension, and `link <https://github.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/blob/e51dd62a2dd156fdd3e559be3930f87f2a4e6405/docs/source/conf.py#L54>`__
  to the other documentation. Inside your documentation you can link to the other library, e.g.
  for data types:

  .. code:: Python

    ...

    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    filter : :py:class:`~numpy.ndarray`
    """

    ...

  which renders as in :func:`pydevtips.fftconvolve.RFFTConvolve.__init__` 
  with a clickable link to NumPy's documentation.
* `Mock modules <https://github.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/blob/e51dd62a2dd156fdd3e559be3930f87f2a4e6405/docs/source/conf.py#L24>`__ to keep your documentation virtual environment light.
* `Add the path <https://github.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/blob/e51dd62a2dd156fdd3e559be3930f87f2a4e6405/docs/source/conf.py#L22>`__ 
  to your package, so that it doesn't have to be installed (again keeping your documentation environment light!).
* `Automate year <https://github.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/blob/e51dd62a2dd156fdd3e559be3930f87f2a4e6405/docs/source/conf.py#L32>`__.
* You can reference other sections in your documentation by their title, e.g. :ref:`like this <Code formatting>` with ``:ref:`like this <Code formatting>``.

Publishing
----------

With a set of HTML files, there are many ways to publish your documentation online.
We present one approach through `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ (RTD), which is
free and very popular among Python developers. Another popular free options is through
`GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`__. I prefer RTD to not have the GitHub username or
organization in the documentation URL.

To publish on RTD:

#. Make an account: https://readthedocs.org/accounts/signup/
#. Import a project from the `dashboard <https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/>`__. There are two ways to do this: (1) linking your GitHub account and selecting one of your **public** repositories, or (2) importing the project manually. When linking to GitHub, the documentation is re-built whenever there are changes to the selected branch.
#. Check your project page for the build status.

You can (optionally) define a `.readthedocs.yaml <https://github.com/ebezzam/python-dev-tips/blob/main/.readthedocs.yaml>`__ 
file to ensure a build environment as close as possible to your local machine.
